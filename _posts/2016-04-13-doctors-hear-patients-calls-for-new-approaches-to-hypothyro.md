Dr. Jonklaas and other researchers involved in the 2014 guidelines also hope to do a clinical trial with 1,200 hypothyroid patients on either T4 alone, T3 and T4 in combination or desiccated thyroid extract. They also plan to test participants for genetic variations and hope to identify subsets of patients who respond better to one treatment or another.

Meanwhile, she and other endocrinologists say they are increasingly willing to try a small dose of T3 in patients who don't feel better on T4 alone.

"I tell patients I don't have a clinical trial that shows this is the right thing to do, but based on my experience, I suggest we try this for three or six months," Dr. Bianco says. "If there's no clear evidence of benefit, we'll discontinue it."

"The important thing is to try to make the patient feel better and do it in a safe way," he says.
