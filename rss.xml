            <description><![CDATA[<p>Dr Power isn't the kind of Dr that treats you as a number as so many do. He's always so upbeat, his personality should be contagious. Can't say I've ever felt better after leaving the Drs office than I do with him. For all his patients our world is a much better place, because of him. He's seen me through some crazy chronic illness, and has never let me or my family down.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I am thoroughly impressed with Dr Power's professional expertise, clinical knowledge, demeanor and his genuine interest in my health and well being. I'm a new patient and he spent nearly an hour with me getting my history and giving me a course of action for continued good living. He is down to earth, energetic, is passionate about medicine and has a great sense of humor, too. His staff is courteous and professional. He is the absolute right doctor for me.</p>]]></description>
